"""
OPTIONAL TODO: Testing

This function implements testing that can (and should) be extended for the
communications lab.

This is primarily so you can execute unit tests on your code without needing
to be a part of a network of devices.

It contains an example that tests the communication protocol parsing for
recieving messages. Also included is some mocking functionality in the folder
testing_modules. These mimic the behaviour of the micro:bit modules. You can
and should extend those, especially if you use new functions in your code.
"""
import sys
import random
from testing_modules import radio, microbit, utime

"""
Here we are setting up the mock libraries so that when we do import our code
that would be flashed, it can actually find and use these modules.

Note that this isn't the actual functionality of those modules - but we are
creating something functionally similar that we can test on. For example, the
radio module on the micro:bit doesn't have a push_message function - we just
need to somehow create a message to read.

"""
sys.modules['radio'] = radio
sys.modules['microbit'] = microbit
sys.modules['utime'] = utime

import commlab
"""
Note: We need to heed the scope of the modules - we must call prototype.radio,
instead of just radio, even though they point to the same module, because
there is a prototype scope that contains its own radio module.

Also note we have only tested happy paths (ideal/standard inputs) here.
